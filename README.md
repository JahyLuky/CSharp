## Overview

This repository contains a collection of C# projects and code samples. It serves as a portfolio of my development skills and includes various applications and modules I have developed.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects included in this repository:

1. **MS SQL Query Tool**: This project is a simple ASP.NET Core application designed to provide a web interface for executing SQL queries against a Microsoft SQL Server database. Users can specify their database connection string and the SQL query they want to execute directly in the `appsettings.json` file.
2. **InventoryTracker**: "InventoryTracker" is a CRUD application built using WPF and .NET 8, designed to manage inventory items efficiently. It implements the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for separating UI from business logic and data models. Integration with MS SQL Server allows database operations for storing and managing inventory data.

## Skills

Throughout the development of these projects, I have gained experience in the following areas:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
- Asynchronous Programming (async/await)
- Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
- Entity Framework
- Unit Testing
