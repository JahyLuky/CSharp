# Arena Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Arena Game! ðŸŽ®

This project is a game that originated as a hobby project during my high school years, and Iâ€™ve recently revisited it to improve and enhance it. The game features a turn-based battle system where various types of charactersâ€”such as Hunters, Warriors, and Magesâ€”compete against each other in an arena. My goal is to build upon and refine the original concept by introducing new mechanics and polishing the gameplay.
## Features

- **Character Classes**: 
  - **Hunters**: A ranged fighter with unique abilities.
  - **Warrior**: A melee combatant with shield mechanics for damage mitigation.
  - **Mage**: A spellcaster with mana and magic attacks.
  
- **Shield Mechanics**: Warriors have a chance to block damage with their shield, with effectiveness varying based on dice rolls.
- **Mana Management**: Mages use mana to perform powerful magic attacks and can recharge mana over time.
